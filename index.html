      <h2>What is Super.Human.Installer?</h2>
      
      <p>Super.Human.Installer is a part of the Genesis.Directory App Catalog, where you can deploy and update your open source applications with just one line.</p>
      <a href="https://genesis.directory/apps/categories" target="_blank">Click here to find out more</a>

      <p>Super.Human.Installer is open source software (OSS). Open source software is software that is distributed with its source code, making it available for use, modification, and distribution with its original rights.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Moonshine-IDE/Super.Human.Installer/releases" target="_blank">Source Code on GitHub</a>

      <h2>Why do you need it?</h2>
      <p>Super.Human.Installer lets you save massive amounts of time. First, it creates an HCL Domino 12.0.2 server on your desktop computer running macOS, Windows, or even Linux. The server can be preconfigured with HCL technologies like Nomad Web, Traveler, Leap, AppDev, or REST API (formerly KEEP). Then, it gives you easy access to the Genesis App Catalog, where you can install a broad array of software from OpenNTF, Prominic, HelpSoft, Vigilus CRM, and other commercial vendors with just one simple console command.</p>

      <p>This is the power of DevOps</p>

      <p>DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development teams and operations teams, with the goal of releasing software more quickly, reliably, and efficiently. DevOps combines elements of software development, quality assurance, and IT operations, and involves the use of automation tools and agile practices to streamline the software delivery process.</p>

      <p>A dedicated app catalog or app marketplace can serve as a secure and centralized platform for users to discover and download new apps, making it easier for users to find and try new software.</p>

      <h2>How to use it?</h2>
      <p>Super.Human.Installer leverages the 
        <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank"><b>VirtualBox</b></a> 
        virtual machine manager and the 
        <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank"><b>Vagrant</b></a> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank"><b>DevOps</b></a> 
        software automation tool to create a Linux based VM on your local computer. There will be one for each 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_Domino" target="_blank"><b>Domino</b></a> 
        server you create.
        <br />
        <br />
        You should only run 1-2 at a time, depending upon your computer's resources. You can define as many as you like, and in each one you can experiment with different configurations and 
        <a href="https://genesis.directory/" target="_blank"><b>Genesis.Directory</b></a> 
        add-ons -- or your own development ideas!
        <br />
        <br />
        The specific steps which are followed based upon the user interface presented by the Super.Human.Installer application are written to a configuration file called a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="_blank"><b>YAML</b></a> 
        file. This YAML file provides instructions to Vagrant such as which version of Domino to install and whether to include additional features like Nomad Web and Node.js development using the AppDev Pack.<br />
        <br />
        The actual control files and scripts can be inspected by you by clicking the Open Server Directory button on any of the existing server instances.
